Copy these folders to `~/.local/share/okteta/structures/`

it will allow Okteta to parse Stunt GP files and help with analysis

Please not thet most of these structures (except PC and WAD) are mostly outdated as I've swithced to documenting formats on wiki since not many users have Linux with Okteta installed
