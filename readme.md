Stunt GP tools

These tools will help you understand, unpack and edit Stunt GP files

# WAD packs
every address and size is in little endian format, almost everything is 4bytes padded

* 4 bytes - `44 49 52 1A` - magic ('DIR' and one non-ASCII character)
* 4 bytes - file size
* 4 bytes - address of something
* file data, usually starts at 0xC and spans up to the "address of something"
    * There's `1A 00` at the end of each file
    * There may be `00` padding after that, so the next file starts at offset % 4 == 0
* at the "address of something" there is `0A 00 00 00`
* After this 4096 bytes of something that I was unable to figure out what it is, necessary for game apparently
    * probably in groups of 4 bytes (always 2 bytes of data, smallest gap between data 2 `00` bytes)
    * 1024 entries
* Later on (the "addres of something" + 4100 bytes) is where the file descriptors start, each one have following structure:

## File descriptor

* 4 bytes - unknown, most files have this set to `00 00 00 00`, few have other stuff there, TODO
* 4 bytes - file offset in archive
* 4 bytes - file size
* file name with path, 4 bytes aligned, terminated by 0x00 (and padded with 0x00 to 4 bytes)

# PC files
All textures are in this format

Every address and size is in little endian format

* 4 bytes - magic `T54 4D 21 1A`, (`TM!` and one unprintable, probably still part of magic, as T17 LOVES aligning stuff)
* 2 bytes???? perhaps format? I only seen this as `03 00`
* 2 bytes width, theroretically up to 65â€¯535
* 2 bytes height
* compressed image data starts at 0xA, see convert.py for implementation details


## Unpacked image data
Uncompressed image data uses 2 bytes for each pixel, in A1 R5 G5 B5 format

## pc_pack.py
Very simple and naive implementation for non-alpha images to see if they will work in-game, no compression yet.

# Various

* wads/fonts.wad: graphics24/fonts/index.txt - uses ISO-8859-1 encoding
